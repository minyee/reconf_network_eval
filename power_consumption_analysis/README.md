## Power Consumption Evaluation

This directory is dedicated to recreating the power consumption analysis from our paper. In this analysis, we primarily compare the total power consumption of PRN, TRN, static expander, and fat tree networks at 3 different scales.

1. Small scale (~1000 end-points) 

2. Medium scale (~10000 end-points)

3. Large scale (~100000 end-points)

### Instructions
* To recreate the scalability analysis, run `python power_analysis.py`.
