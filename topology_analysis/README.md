## Scalability Evaluation

This directory contains the network scalability evaluation from our paper. 
The evaluation compares the maximize attainable network size, measured in terms of total number of server end points, different network topologies can support. 
We primarily compare the scalability between PRN, TRN, static expander and fat tree. 

1) In order to run the scalability analysis, simply run `python routing_simulator.py`.

2) In order to run the path distribution of PRN and TRN, simply run `python path_capacity_dist.py`.
